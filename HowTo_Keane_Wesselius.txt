How to run the project from command prompt
Requires Godot game engine to run
Godot does not install on a computer, you just run it when you want to use it
Project was built on Godot version 3.4.4, theortically any 3.X version should work but errors may occur if version is not 3.4.4

1. Change working directory to the project folder.    example C:\Users\Keane\Desktop\Godot\Calc>
2. Call the file path of the Godot.exe    example "C:\Users\Keane\Desktop\Godot_v3.4.4-stable_win64.exe"
Thats it

All together the command prompt should look like this

Directory_of_godot_project_folder> "file_path_of_godot.exe"
